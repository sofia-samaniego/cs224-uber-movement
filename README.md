# CS224W - Analysis of Networks: Final Project

Final project for CS224W Fall 2017 at Stanford University. 

Utilizing the Movement data set recently released by Uber, we propose to analyze and discern traffic bottlenecks in multiple cities.
Further, we plan to uncover gen- eral traffic movement patterns throughout these cities at various times in the day and identify the main differences in mobility behavior between them.
Finally, we plan to come up with a solution to alleviate traffic on our identified bottlenecks and measure its impact through simulated data.
